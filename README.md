## 🧠 1. Patient Monitoring Features
 - Real-Time Location Tracking (GPS): Continuously monitor patient movement and alert if they wander beyond safe zones.
 - Geo-Fencing Alerts: Notify caretakers if the patient leaves a predefined safe area.
 - Activity Recognition (AI/ML): Detect walking, sleeping, sitting, or potential falls using device sensors.
 - Fall Detection: Immediate alert on sudden drops or inactivity suggestive of a fall.
 - Vitals Integration (Optional via wearables): Monitor heart rate, oxygen level, etc., if synced with smart bands.

## 🧩 2. Cognitive Assistance Features
 - Daily Routine Reminders: Medications, meals, hygiene, and appointments.
 - Voice Assistance (Conversational AI): Simple voice-based interaction to answer questions and guide actions.
 - Face Recognition for Familiar People: Helps identify family, friends, and caregivers.
 - Memory Diary (Photo + Voice Notes): Helps patients store and recall events via multimedia.
 - Calendar and Events Visualizer: Color-coded reminders for upcoming events.

## 🆘 3. Emergency & Alert Features
 - Emergency SOS Button: Direct call/message to caretaker with live location.
 - Auto Alerts to Multiple Caregivers: Notify all concerned via SMS, app, or email.
 - Unusual Behavior Detection (AI-powered): Alert when sudden disorientation, agitation, or nighttime wandering is detected.

## 🔒 4. Caregiver Dashboard Features
 - Multi-Patient Monitoring: For professional caregivers monitoring multiple patients.
 - Real-Time Notifications and Logs: Timeline of alerts, reminders sent, vitals, and behavior patterns.
 - Shared Access: Family and healthcare professionals can view/edit routines and notes.
 - AI-Generated Health Reports: Weekly summaries of behavior trends and alerts.

## 🌐 5. Connectivity & Integration
 - Wearable Integration: Connect with smartwatches, fitness bands, or fall sensors.
 - Voice Assistant Integration (Alexa/Google Assistant): For ambient reminders at home.
 - Cloud Sync + Offline Mode: Store essential data locally and sync to cloud when connected.

## 🧩 6. User Experience & Accessibility
 - Lightweight & Offline-Compatible App: Minimal resource usage; usable in low-connectivity zones.
 - Large Fonts & High Contrast UI: Tailored for elderly users with vision challenges.
 - Multilingual & Voice Input Support: Local language support with simple voice commands.
